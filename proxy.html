<h1><b>Simple proxy server</b></h1>
<section><i>Description of this project:</i></section>
<p>
This is the final project that I did for my CSCI 379 networking class in 2019.<br/>
This is a simple proxy server that accept an http request from the client and forward the request to the remote server.<br/>
Which the remote server will then reply with an http response to the proxy sever and the proxy will return the response to it client.<br/>
The proxy server act like a middle man between the client and the remote server.<br/>
This program is written using the TCP socket programming.
